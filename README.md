**Be a Pioneer: Help Us Test the New Sabi App!** 🚀

Tired of the campus shuffle? We're looking for students to be the first to test Sabi, a new app built to make our campus life easier.

**Are you tired of...**

Walking all the way to your favourite study spot, only to find it's already taken?

That awkward moment of peeping into a classroom and accidentally disrupting an ongoing lecture?

Trying to organize a game of basketball, volleyball, or soccer at the court, but never knowing when it's free?

**Sabi is the solution! With the Sabi app, you can:**

✅ **Know Your Space Instantly:** See which study rooms, classrooms, and quiet spots are free in real-time, right from your phone.

🏀 **Schedule a Match:** Propose a game on the court schedule and get your friends to join. No more guesswork!

🎓 **Help Our Campus Grow:** By using the app, you're not just saving yourself time—you're helping the university manage its resources better for everyone.

We need your valuable feedback to make this app perfect for our community. Be part of the solution!


Let's make our campus smarter, together.
